# A-learning-tour-to-C-
Refer to the book: Discovering Modern C++ An Intensive Course for Scientists, Engineers, and Programmers and start a journey to experience C++

The original goal is to experience and learn some useful features as well as programming techniques of C++, which is a very popular and useful computer programming language in real world. Initially, I just find that it's pretty slow and time-consuming to use other developed softwares such as Matlab or especially R to carry out some missions invovling "for" loop or other heavy-burden ones and this motivates me to seek for some other more efficient languages, while C++ is eactly a good choice and is very popular itself.

The main purpose is to conduct some calculations, particularly in mathematical and scientific computing but not purely for programming which is quite different from pure computer science.
