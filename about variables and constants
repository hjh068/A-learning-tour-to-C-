Note that once defined, the type of each variable will not change and those mainly used are:

int; regular integer number
float; single-precision f loating-point number
double; double-precision f loating-point number
char；letter and very short integer number
bool；boolean (true or false)
short； rather short integer number
long; long integer number
long long; very long integer number
unsigned; unsigned versions of all the former
long double; long floating-point number

Due to the inability to change the type of variables, there are suggestions to assign the type right before you decide to use them. 

In C++11, the type can be deduced automatically, i.e. using 
auto;

For parameters in modeling, some are usually fixed as constants, to avoid fraud use, they can be assigned as constants:

const int a=2; et.
i.e. using const+type

then they will be fixed throughout the programming.
